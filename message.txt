Lilcoin ($LIL) is the first token that uses self-arbitrage to rewards holders with no fees/reflections. At its heart is an algorithm that monitors $LIL across the exchanges it is listed on, 'arbing' $LIL any time there is a price mismatch. This generates claimable profits for holders, which would otherwise be pocketed by bots and institutions. 

The Lilguys NFT Collection is a collection of 8500 unique, randomly-generated characters living on the Etherium Blockchain. Art curated by the acclaimed graphic designer behind Lilcoin. Each lilguy grants its owner access to 125k $LIL. Each $LIL owner will get a chance to win 1 of 10 lilguy giveaways.
